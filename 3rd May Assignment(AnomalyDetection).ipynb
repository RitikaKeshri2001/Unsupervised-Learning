    "### Q1. What is the role of feature selection in anomaly detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection can help to reduce the dimensionality, complexity and noise of the data, and improve the performance and interpretability of the anomaly detection model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roles of feature selection in anomaly detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dimensionality reduction:  Feature selection techniques can reduce the dimensionality of the data by selecting a subset of relevant features. By reducing the dimensionality, feature selection helps to simplify the analysis and mitigate the \"curse of dimensionality,\" where the performance of anomaly detection algorithms deteriorates as the number of features increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Noise reduction: Feature selection helps to identify and exclude noisy features, leading to a cleaner and more focused representation of the data. This improves the accuracy and robustness of anomaly detection algorithms by reducing the impact of irrelevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computational efficiency: By reducing the dimensionality of the data, feature selection can significantly improve the computational efficiency of anomaly detection algorithms. With fewer features to process, the detection process becomes faster and more scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overfitting prevention: Feature selection helps to mitigate overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model and focusing on the most informative features. This promotes better generalization and improves the model's ability to detect anomalies in unseen data."

    "### Q3. What is DBSCAN and how does it work for clustering?\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. It depends on a density-based notion of cluster. It is a clustering algorithm that groups data points based on their density, i.e., the number of data points in a given neighborhood. It also identifies clusters of arbitrary size in the spatial database with outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN algorithms start by picking a point(one record) x from the dataset at random and assign it to a cluster 1. Then it counts how many points are located within the ∈ (epsilon) distance from x. If this quantity is greater than or equal to minPoints (n), then considers it as core point, then it will pull out all these ∈-neighbours to the same cluster 1. It will then examine each member of cluster 1 and find their respective ∈ -neighbours. If some member of cluster 1 has n or more ∈-neighbours, it will expand cluster 1 by putting those ∈-neighbours to the cluster. It will continue expanding cluster 1 until there are no more examples to put in it. \n",

    "### Q4. How does the epsilon parameter affect the performance of DBSCAN in detecting anomalies?\n",
    "\n",
    "A larger eps value means that more data points are considered as neighbors, and thus more likely to be clustered together. A smaller eps value means that fewer data points are considered as neighbors, and thus more likely to be isolated as outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the eps value is too large, then the algorithm may merge different clusters into one, and miss some subtle anomalies. A larger epsilon value can increase the likelihood of noise points being connected to clusters, leading to a higher chance of anomalies being misclassified as part of a cluster.  If the eps value is too small, then the algorithm may split a cluster into several subclusters, and generate many false anomalies. A smaller epsilon value leads to higher density requirements for points to be considered neighbors. As a result, DBSCAN may identify smaller and more tightly-packed clusters. This can make it more challenging for anomalies, which often exhibit lower density or reside in sparse regions, to be included in any cluster. Therefore, a smaller epsilon can make it harder for DBSCAN to detect anomalies."

    "\n",
    "- DBSCAN expands clusters by connecting core points and their density-reachable neighbors. Density reachability means that there exists a path of core points connecting two points, such that each pair of consecutive core points is within ∈ distance. This process expands clusters by iteratively adding density-reachable points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Border points and noise points: Border points are points that have fewer neighboring points than MinPts but fall within ∈ distance of a core point. Points that are neither core points nor border points are classified as noise points or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anomaly detection: Anomalies are indirectly detected by considering noise points as instances that deviate from the general patterns captured by the clusters. Since anomalies do not conform to the density-based assumptions of normal instances in clusters, they are typically classified as noise points. These noise points represent instances that do not belong to any cluster and are potential candidates for anomalies."
